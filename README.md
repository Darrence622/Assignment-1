# Assignment-1
Interactive Development Assignment 1

This HTML file that I worked on consists of a general portfolio of me. There is a home page that navigates to the "About Me" section and "Works" section. About me section consists of my school life and works section are the projects that I have worked on.
 
## Design Process
 
My website will be for an assignment, and my personal portflio. It will be changed and ammended over time in my poly years so as to use it for interviews in the future.

As an interviewer, I want to be able to view my interviewee's portfolio to gain a gist of what he/she does, excel and weaknesses.


## Features

My webpage has a side navigation bar that features all links, a contact page that links to my social media page, a form for users to submit so to contact me.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users to fill up a form to contact me

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
-Horizontal scrolling
-Pop out navigation bar (fade in fade out)

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    -The project uses **HTML** for everything


## Testing
My project looks different and media query works for Iphone X on 78% zoom. Other mobile will look different and positioning will be off

A bug that I have noticed was that, previewing my individual works alters the position in a way which is not what I wanted. However, if I navigate to my work page from home page, the position is what i want.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
